            which improved the quality scores
            • Developed a python script to extract the productivity metrics of all
            the employees in the program using Pandas and NumPy
            framework which helped to track productivity and perform TMS
            (Time and Motion Study) to standardize the time for the task.
            • Build a cost effective mechanism using SQL, where the queries are
            scheduled to run on a daily basis to capture all counterfeit products
            on Amazon website and take relevant action to ensure Customer
            trust.
            • Developed a python script which can manipulate data based on
            predefined validations and can split the work into different files
            which makes it easy to assign work
            • Identified an operational issue in a program and proposed
            solutions for smooth functioning of the program. For example,
            identified in capturing more than 20000 counterfeit products in a

            increase the coverage"

            work and resource prioritization and meeting all the targets.
            • Automated identification and classification of various Seller fee
            configurations, by creating a repository of all configurations with
            their short IDs. This eliminated manual errors in mapping a short ID
            to a Fee configuration request and saved 8 hrs of audit time weekly
            • Trained 5 associates on various internal tools of Amazon and basic
            to intermediate SQL skills. Acted as a team player by suggesting
            ways to optimize a program's audits by using multiple tools or
            having SQL queries.
            • Developed a python script which helped in mapping the attributes
            based on most number of keywords matched which helped in
            categorizing the products with the correct attribute.
